Good thing is that net benefit of treated increases as the variables increases for Xgboost (best model). I think we probably should not add these points to the AUC plot as the scale being different will be frowned upon as causing bias in interpretation. We should probably just keep as a separate table to justify why we kept using 27 best variable of Xgboost that net benefit increases as variable size increases. Does this sound reasonable?
